GRAPHS

sky:
	graph of I with marked sky_determination zones
	mark points outside the clipping zone

truncation detection:
similar to figure 6 in trujilo but with the inner and outer stds/means shown as well

histogram of truncation strength (not just discrete types but a range i.e. delta h)
trunc. strength vs radius etcs

IDEA

-ve values displayed using zp+2.5log10(I)
